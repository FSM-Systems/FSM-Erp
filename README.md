### Database updating Routes:

### /api/db/update_db_field
This is used to update a given field in the database from any input. The attributes required in the input field in order to make it work are: 

>col="\<column to update in db>\"

>colid="\<id_field_of_row_to_update_in_the_db>\", Usually the primary key

>colidval="\<id_value_of_the_id_column>\", usually the value of the primary key

In order to work every input must have a unique id which can be generated by adding a name_\<serial value from primary key>\. The class .update has to be added to the input element. The table name to update will come from a hidden input with id dbtable: 

>\<input type="hidden" id="dbtable" value="table to update in db">\

### /api/db/insert_db_field
to be written

### /api/db/delete_db_field
to be written

### Autocompletes
Create the route that returns label and value in JSON format in the autocomplete.js routes files
The display element will have to be called like the name of the field with an added "_txt" strin after it
Place a \<input type="hidden" name="field" id="field">\ under the display element
Add an attribute to the input element called ac-source="\<name of the route in autcompletes.js>\" The library will automatically take care of filling the name in the \<input name="xxxx_txt" id="xxx_txt">\ field and the correct value in the \<input name="xxxx" id="xxxx">\ field
You can then use the hidden field to trigger updates in the database table by folliwing the update_db_field method (add .update class)
Do not use the _txt field as this will send the text and make the update fail. (If you are using foreign keys to identify the item)
